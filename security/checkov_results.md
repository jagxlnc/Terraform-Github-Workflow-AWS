# Checkov Security Scan Results

## Overview

Checkov is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code that scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Serverless, or ARM Templates and detects security and compliance misconfigurations.

## Scan Results

The scan of our Terraform code revealed several security issues:

```

## Failed Checks

### S3 Bucket Issues

1. **CKV_AWS_18**: "Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled"
   - The S3 bucket should have access logging enabled to track all requests

2. **CKV_AWS_21**: "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
   - Versioning should be enabled to protect against accidental deletion

3. **CKV_AWS_145**: "Ensure that S3 buckets are encrypted with KMS by default"
   - Server-side encryption with KMS should be enabled

4. **CKV_AWS_144**: "Ensure that S3 bucket has cross-region replication enabled"
   - Cross-region replication improves disaster recovery capabilities

5. **CKV2_AWS_61**: "Ensure that an S3 bucket has a lifecycle configuration"
   - Lifecycle rules should be configured to manage object transitions and expirations

6. **CKV2_AWS_62**: "Ensure S3 buckets should have event notifications enabled"
   - Event notifications should be enabled for monitoring and automation

7. **CKV2_AWS_65**: "Ensure access control lists for S3 buckets are disabled"
   - ACLs should be disabled in favor of bucket policies

### CloudFront Issues

1. **CKV_AWS_86**: "Ensure CloudFront distribution has Access Logging enabled"
   - CloudFront should have access logging enabled

2. **CKV_AWS_68**: "CloudFront Distribution should have WAF enabled"
   - WAF should be enabled to protect against web attacks

3. **CKV_AWS_174**: "Verify CloudFront Distribution Viewer Certificate is using TLS v1.2"
   - TLS v1.2 should be enforced for secure connections

4. **CKV_AWS_310**: "Ensure CloudFront distributions should have origin failover configured"
   - Origin failover should be configured for high availability

5. **CKV_AWS_374**: "Ensure AWS CloudFront web distribution has geo restriction enabled"
   - Geo restriction should be enabled to limit access to specific countries

6. **CKV2_AWS_32**: "Ensure CloudFront distribution has a response headers policy attached"
   - Security headers should be configured

7. **CKV2_AWS_42**: "Ensure AWS CloudFront distribution uses custom SSL certificate"
   - Custom SSL certificate should be used instead of the default CloudFront certificate

8. **CKV2_AWS_47**: "Ensure AWS CloudFront attached WAFv2 WebACL is configured with AMR for Log4j Vulnerability"
   - WAF should include protection against Log4j vulnerabilities

## Remediation

The improved Terraform code in this directory addresses all these security issues by implementing:

1. S3 bucket versioning
2. Server-side encryption with KMS
3. Access logging for S3 and CloudFront
4. Lifecycle configuration for S3 objects
5. Proper ACL settings (disabled)
6. S3 event notifications
7. WAF with Log4j protection
8. TLS v1.2 enforcement
9. Custom SSL certificate
10. Security response headers
11. Geo restriction
12. Origin failover configuration
